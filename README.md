This was my first project using C.<br>
This project simulates the working of a mini banking system where users can open accounts, deposit and withdraw cash, borrow loans, etc.<br><br>

In order to execute the application, go to it's directory and type the following commands in Windows command prompt:<br><br>
mingw32-make -f run.mk<br>
bankingSystem.exe<br>
